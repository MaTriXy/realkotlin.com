## Contributing
I would ‚ù§Ô∏è  some contributions from other authors here. Just follow these steps

 - Fork this repository
 - Add yourself as an author in `_data/authors.yml`
 - Create a new entry in `_tutorials` (it's easier to copy an existing one and make your changes. Don't forget to change the author name to be you)
 - Send me a pull request with everything
 - ü§ó  wait for my virtual hug
